  "summary": "The diff modifies EnrollmentSection.tsx to move the email callout (athletes@velocityhealthclinic.com) outside the conditional form/success block so it is always visible. The file-diff summary explicitly confirms this fix. All acceptance criteria for REQ-13 appear to be addressed: the email is always rendered regardless of form state, uses inline styles to ensure visibility, and is present in both idle and submitted states.",
