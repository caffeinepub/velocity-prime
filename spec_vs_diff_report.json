The diff shows the component was modified to include a styled 'email us directly' callout with athletes@velocityhealthclinic.com as a clickable mailto link using amber theming, consistent with the existing dark/amber visual theme. The file summary explicitly confirms this. The form fields and submit button remain unchanged. All four acceptance criteria appear to be satisfied.",
