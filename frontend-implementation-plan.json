Review conditional rendering logic around form states (idle, submitting, success) to ensure the email callout is always rendered. Check for any CSS classes that might hide the element (hidden, invisible, opacity-0, sr-only, etc.). Ensure the email is rendered outside any conditional blocks tied to form submission state. Verify the mailto link or text callout has proper visibility styling and is not affected by parent container styles. Test that the email displays correctly on both mobile and desktop breakpoints."
